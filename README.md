# Convert Madcap Flare projects to DITA XML


## What the project does:

  - Creates a DITA Map from the table of contents file.
  - Creates a plain DITA XML topic for each HTML file.
    - Converts HTML tables to DITA XML tables.
    - Converts Flare variables and reusable content to DITA XML key references or content references.
    - Converts Flare change tracking markers and comments to Oxygen XML change tracking markers and comments.
    - Converts Flare links to DITA XML links.

Limitations:

  - There is no support yet for profiling attributes migrations.
  - The table column widths and cell/row spans are not taken into account.
  - There is no support yet for creating DITAVAL filter files.
  - Headings are usually converted to plain DITA XML paragraphs with bold text so they need to be manually converted to DITA XML sections or inner topics.
  
  
## How to use it to migrate your Flare project to DITA using Oxygen XML Editor/Author

- Install Oxygen XML Editor/Author.
- Download a zipped version of the project and unzip it.
- Copy your Flare project into the **flareProject** folder. The content of your Flare Project should look like this:
```
[this folder]
  _rels
  Content
  Project
  [Content_Types].xml
  EmployeeManual.flprj
```

- Start Oxygen, go to **Project -> Open project** and open the **flareToDita.xpr**.
- in the **Project** view, right click the **flareToDITA.xsl** file and in the contextual menu select **Transform->Apply Transformation Scenario(s)**.

### Result

The DITA Map is generated in the location *flareProject/f/Project/TOCs/TOC.ditamap* and a *\*.dita* file will be generated next to every *\*.htm* file.



## Publishing to WebHelp or PDF

The ditamap should be opened automatically in the **DITA Maps Manager**, but, just in case it doesn't, locate it inside the **Project** view and double click it.

- In the **DITA Maps Manager** view, on the toolbar, click the **Configure transformation scenario(s)** button
- In the **Configure transformation scenario(s)** dialog, select **DITA Map WebHelp Responsive** and click **Duplicate** from under the list
- Go on the **Parameters** tab and set the **fix.external.refs.com.oxygenxml** parameter to true (it needs to be set because the **DITA Map** refers to resources outside its folder, as it mirrors the flare project).
- Click **OK** and then **Apply Associated**.

To Obtain a PDF perform the above procedure again, but this time use the **DITA Map PDF - based on HTML5 & CSS** scenario
